1. Introduction

1.1 Background
Time series data is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. It is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, weather forecasting, and energy demand prediction. Accurate time series analysis and prediction are crucial for making informed decisions and optimizing resource allocation.

4.2 Strengths and Weaknesses

ARIMA
Strengths: Captures linear trends and seasonal patterns effectively; widely used and understood.
Weaknesses: Poor performance on data with complex nonlinear patterns; negative R² score indicates poor fit.

ANN
Strengths: Handles complex nonlinear relationships well; high R² score indicates good fit.
Weaknesses: Requires more computational resources and time for training; sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.

SARIMA
Strengths: Extends ARIMA to handle seasonality explicitly; effective for seasonal data.
Weaknesses: Higher error metrics compared to other models; complex model tuning.

ETS
Strengths: Simple and intuitive; handles trend and seasonality well.
Weaknesses: High MAPE and SMAPE values indicate poor performance on this dataset; less flexible for complex patterns.

Prophet
Strengths: Handles seasonality and holidays well; easy to use and interpret.
Weaknesses: Higher MSE compared to ANN and LSTM; may require manual tuning for optimal performance.




SVR
Strengths: Effective for small to medium-sized datasets; captures nonlinear patterns with appropriate kernel selection.
Weaknesses: Performance highly dependent on parameter tuning; higher MAE and MSE compared to ANN and LSTM.

LSTM
Strengths: Excellent at capturing long-term dependencies and nonlinear patterns; lowest MAE and MSE among all models.
Weaknesses: Requires significant computational power; complex architecture and tuning.

Hybrid ARIMA-ANN
Strengths: Combines strengths of ARIMA and ANN; handles both linear and nonlinear patterns.
Weaknesses: Higher error metrics compared to standalone ANN and LSTM; more complex implementation and tuning.


4.3 Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:
Best Overall Model: The LSTM model outperforms other models with the lowest MAE and MSE, making it the best choice for this dataset.
For Linear and Seasonal Patterns: The ARIMA and SARIMA models are suitable for datasets with strong linear trends and seasonal patterns.
For Ease of Use: Prophet provides a good balance of ease of use and performance, especially for datasets with seasonal and holiday effects.
For Hybrid Approaches: Consider using hybrid models like ARIMA-ANN for datasets with both linear and complex nonlinear patterns, though they may require more effort in implementation and tuning.




Summary of Findings:
•	The LSTM model demonstrated the best performance, capturing complex patterns effectively.
•	ANN and Prophet models also performed well, with ANN showing a strong ability to handle nonlinear relationships.
•	Traditional models like ARIMA and SARIMA were less effective due to their inability to capture complex nonlinear patterns present in the data.
•	ETS showed the highest error metrics, indicating it was not well-suited for this dataset.
•	Hybrid models offer potential for improved accuracy but require careful implementation and tuning.



Conclusion:
This comprehensive analysis demonstrates the varying strengths and weaknesses of different time series models. The LSTM model stands out for its superior accuracy, making it the preferred choice for this dataset. However, the choice of model should consider the specific characteristics of the dataset and the computational resources available.
